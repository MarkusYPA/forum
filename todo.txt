x spell time and date better, maybe two rows
x align first level replies to left
x implement:
    x register user
    x login
    x logout
x start thread only if logged in
    x shows if session is valid
    x works if session is valid
x reply only if logged in (name and id to message or reply)
    x show reply button if session is valid
    x reply button only works if session is valid
x header to display "logged in as <Name>" and maybe logout/login link
x check session validity at:
    x load log in
    x log in
    x register
    x log out too?
x implement like and dislike
    x increment/decrement thread/reply likes/dislikes by one
    x If thread/reply is not on liked/disliked increment, otherwise decrement
    x some coloring to see if post is already liked by user
x cookies to limit length and track sessions
x Should expired sessions be cleared from db? How and when?
x Threads with most recent post to the top
x Look for allowed method
x do not allow multiple sessions for one user (delete olds when logging in)
x prevent html and Js in all input
x UUID for used id
x for category search something on the front page:
    x if session is valid: Dropdown for: all, created, liked and disliked
    x text input for categories
    x queries that work
    x filter by all search terms:
        x inclusive (match any)
        x exclusive (match all)
x limit title and categories length
x prevent duplicate categories

- check input lengths (title, categories, content) on server side 
- terms consistency: "sign"/"log", thread/post, etc.
- category items to (search?) links
- proper error page
- remove e-mail from login page (combined field for user name or email)
- redirect to thread page after it's creation (not to the list of threads)
- categories table?

Frontend (jedi):
- Filter reset button resets both?
- Filter criteria (search, show) might be better if both are fulfilled (do not reset the other one); example: search 'coffee' categs + show created by me only.
- Update all pages
    - Update thread repplies
    - Replies to replies button not working
- Error page
- Footer
- left and right nav contents ?
x fix grid (header, leftnav, middle content, rightnav)
x new post modal (popup) applied so that 'clear' button does not show that it resets the filters also
