    - register
    - log out too?
- implement like and dislike
    x increment/decrement thread/reply likes/dislikes by one
    x If thread/reply is not on liked/disliked increment, otherwise decrement
    - some coloring to see if post is already liked by user
x cookies to limit length and track sessions
- for filtering, create a bar on the front page:
    . if session is valid: checkboxes for created, liked and disliked
    . text input for categories
- category items to links
